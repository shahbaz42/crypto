Basic implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, as outlined in the NIST FIPS PUB 180-4 standard (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf). 

### Disclaimer: 

If you're looking for an SHA-256 implementation to secure your nuclear launch codes, encrypt your top-secret cat videos, or power your underground cryptocurrency casino, well... you've come to the wrong place. This code is about as secure as a chocolate padlock.

But hey, if you're a curious soul who wants to peek inside the hashing sausage factory, or a digital archaeologist excavating the ruins of SHA-256, then welcome! This code is your shovel (a slightly wobbly, plastic one, mind you).

Just remember, this is about as practical as using a butter knife to build a spaceship. So grab your metaphorical popcorn, put on your safety goggles, and enjoy the educational fireworks!

P.S. If you do manage to crack the something using this code, please send pizza. I am not judging (much).
